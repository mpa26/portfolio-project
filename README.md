# Portfolio-project
The fist project for portfolio

# Description
This is a big project for my portfolio. This is necessary in order to show my skills. 

# Run autotest with params
> pytest -v --tb=line --language=en test_main_page.py

Option "PyTest --tb=line" specifies that only one line should be output from the log of each failed test.
This will make it easier to understand what the error messages look like.

# Help
- Save all package versions to a special file: 
	> pip freeze > requirements.txt

- In a fresh environment, all packages can be installed with one command:
	> pip install -r requirements.txt
